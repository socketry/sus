# Sus

Sus is a testing framework for Ruby.

  - It's similar to RSpec but with less baggage and more parallelism.
  - It uses `expect` style syntax with first-class predicates.
  - It has direct [support for code coverage](https://github.com/socketry/covered).
  - It supports the [VSCode Test Runner interface](https://github.com/socketry/sus-vscode).
  - It's based on my experience writing thousands of tests.
  - It's easy to extend (see the `sus-fixtures-` gems for examples).

## Releases

Please see the [project releases](https://socketry.github.io/sus/releases/index) for all releases.

### v0.34.0

  - Allow `expect(...).to receive(...)` to accept one or more calls (at least once).

### v0.33.0

  - Add support for `agent-context` gem.
  - [`receive` now supports blocks and `and_raise`.](https://socketry.github.io/sus/releases/index#receive-now-supports-blocks-and-and_raise.)

### v0.32.0

  - `Sus::Config` now has a `prepare_warnings!` hook which enables deprecated warnings by default. This is generally considered good behaviour for a test framework.
